## Experiment Details
In the experiments, we consider the least squares problem. 

### Experiment 1 
In this experiment, we want to test the recovery accuracy of our algorithm. We fix the signal-to-noise (SNR) to generate the data and compute the reconstruction SNR (RSNR) using the recovered solution. This experiment shows that our algorithm achieve high accuracy in a short time. In addition, the solution is robost since it attains a low standard error. The data and the code (including Matlab and Python) can be found in the Experiment 1.
